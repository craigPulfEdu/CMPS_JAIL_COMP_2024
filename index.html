        <h1> Understanding Different Financial Concepts</h1>
        
        <h2>Here are some Financial Terms that we will be discussing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Debt</li>
            <li>Credit</li>
            <li>Credit Score</li>
            <li>Savings</li>
            <li>Investment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Debt</h3>

        <p>Debt is essentially the money that you one to one or multiple individuals or organizations.
            Some types of debt may be necessary to hold such as debts obtained for higher education, or debt obtained
            from heathcare providers.
        </p>

        <h3>Credit</h3>
        <p>
        Credit an agreement between a lender and a borrower to allow the borrow to use funds and repay at a later date.
        There are three types of credit which are revolving credit which is a line a credit (money) that somebody has access to and
        agrees to pay back in installments. Open-credit is very similar to revolving credit, but the pay-back terms are more loosely defined
        then with revolving credit. Installment Credit which is when a lump sum of money is borrowed and paid backt to the lender by the borrower in fixed amounts.
        </p>
        <h3>Credit Score</h3>
        <p>Credit Scores are used by financial firms to analyze how credit worthy somebody is based on different factors. The factors considered
            are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment History</li>
            <li>Debt Owed</li>
            <li>Length of Credit History</li>
            <li>Newly Aquired Creidt</li>
            <li>Mix of Credit Acounts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Credit Scores are obtained whenever you first begin opening lines of credit. Most students at Point Park likely have one
            since many students take out loans to pay for education. A good credit score is useful for obtaining a bigger loan amount
            for a purchase like a car or a house, but unfortunately even some landlords will run a credit inquiry on people looking to lease/rent an
            apartment or house making it more of a requirement to maintain a good credit score.
        </p>

        <h3>Savings</h3>
        <p> Savings are basically just incomet that you are not spending in the moment, but keeping for a later date. There are plenty
            of different savings philosophies on how much income should go to savings, but generally its good practice to have an emergency
            fund so when something unexpected occurs you can pay for it without going into debt. Its also good practice to have a set amount
            put into savings weekly or monthly but this amount may vary based on your financial goals and situation.
        </p>
        <h3>Investment</h3>
        <p>

            and patience in order to ensure you are investing in the right things and allowing these investments to bring return.
        </p>
        <h4>Before Investing you should know:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What you are investing in</li>
        <p>You should know what you are investing in before you invest in it. This means doing research and ensuring that what you
            are investing it can reasonably give you a good return on investment, but also avoid being scammed if the investment seems
            to good to be true or is just an untraditional form of investment.
        </p>
            <li>How Risky is your investment</li>
        <p>
            You may be intrigued by some investments because it promises a very high return, but the reality of most investmnet is that it
            takes a long time to see a noticable return on investment, and while high risk investment may be temping it can cause you to
            loose a lot of money or even put you in a situation where you find yourself in debt
        </p>
            <li>Pay off Debt or Invest?</li>
        <p>
            It may be tricky to figure out if you should invest money or pay off debt, but it really just depends. If an employer is matching
            your investment in some type of investment account (usually a 401k) then you should 100% invest up until what they match, but after
            this it will be more beneficial to pay off any high interest debt like credit cards. If the interest rate on a loan then generally 
            it is advisable 7% you may want to prioritize paying this off before investing.
