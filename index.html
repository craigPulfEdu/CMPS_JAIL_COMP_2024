        <h1> Understanding Different Financial Concepts</h1>
        
        <h2>Here are some Financial Terms that we will be discussing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Debt</li>
            <li>Budgeting</li>
            <li>Credit & Credit Score</li>
            <li>Savings</li>
            <li>Investment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Budgeting</h3>
        <p>Budgeting is a calculated plan which you follow for a set amount of time. Personal Financial Budgeting involves
            taking you income and setting allocated amount for each part of your life including necessary expenses, entertainment
            expenses, personal expenses and investment and saving expenses. Budgeting is very useful for having personal finances in order.
        </p>

        <h3>Debt</h3>

        <p>Debt is essentially the money that you one to one or multiple individuals or organizations.
            Some types of debt may be necessary to hold such as debts obtained for higher education, or debt obtained
            from heathcare providers.
        </p>

        <h3>Credit</h3>
        <p>
        Credit an agreement between a lender and a borrower to allow the borrow to use funds and repay at a later date.
        There are three types of credit which are revolving credit which is a line a credit (money) that somebody has access to and
        agrees to pay back in installments. Open-credit is very similar to revolving credit, but the pay-back terms are more loosely defined
        then with revolving credit. Installment Credit which is when a lump sum of money is borrowed and paid backt to the lender by the borrower in fixed amounts.
        </p>
    

        <h3>Credit Score</h3>
        <p>Credit Scores are used by financial firms to analyze how credit worthy somebody is based on different factors. The factors considered
            are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment History</li>
            <li>Debt Owed</li>
            <li>Length of Credit History</li>
            <li>Newly Aquired Creidt</li>
            <li>Mix of Credit Acounts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Credit Scores are obtained whenever you first begin opening lines of credit. Most students at Point Park likely have one
            since many students take out loans to pay for education. A good credit score is useful for obtaining a bigger loan amount
            for a purchase like a car or a house, but unfortunately even some landlords will run a credit inquiry on people looking to lease/rent an
            apartment or house making it more of a requirement to maintain a good credit score.
        </p>

        <h3>Savings</h3>
        <p> Savings are basically just incomet that you are not spending in the moment, but keeping for a later date. There are plenty
            of different savings philosophies on how much income should go to savings, but generally its good practice to have an emergency
            fund so when something unexpected occurs you can pay for it without going into debt. Its also good practice to have a set amount
            put into savings weekly or monthly but this amount may vary based on your financial goals and situation.
        </p>

        <h3>Investment</h3>
        <p>
            Investment is a very important things that can put you ahead financially, but it requires commitment, education,
            and patience in order to ensure you are investing in the right things and allowing these investments to bring return.
        </p>
        <h4>Before Investing you should know:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What you are investing in</li>
        <p>You should know what you are investing in before you invest in it. This means doing research and ensuring that what you
            are investing it can reasonably give you a good return on investment, but also avoid being scammed if the investment seems
            to good to be true or is just an untraditional form of investment.
        </p>
            <li>How Risky is your investment</li>
        <p>
            You may be intrigued by some investments because it promises a very high return, but the reality of most investmnet is that it
            takes a long time to see a noticable return on investment, and while high risk investment may be temping it can cause you to
            loose a lot of money or even put you in a situation where you find yourself in debt. Some individuals though have higher risk
            tolerance and are okay with higher risk investments.
        </p>
            <li>Pay off Debt or Invest?</li>
        <p>
            It may be tricky to figure out if you should invest money or pay off debt, but it really just depends. If an employer is matching
            your investment in some type of investment account (usually a 401k) then you should 100% invest up until what they match, but after
            this it will be more beneficial to pay off any high interest debt like credit cards. If the interest rate on a loan then generally 
            it is advisable that at a rate of 8-9%+ you may want to prioritize paying this off before investing as most investments won't
            yield a higher return than this. 
        </p>
            <li>Do you know what you're doing?</li>
        <p>
            You might think that you can make a quick flip on some stocks or crypto currency, and this may be the case, but a lot of us don't
            know what we are doing, and there is nothing wrong with this, but if you are unsure about what you are doing you should seek advice
            from experts or even just online if you're looking for the less formal do-it-yourself route.
        </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding your financial situation</h2>
        <p>
            There are different factors which patter whenever you are assessing your current financial situation. One is income vs expenses which

        <h1>Understanding Loans</h1>

        <p>Loans can be tricky and hard to understand how much you are really paying. Typically a loan will have a fixed monthly payment
            for a period of time. A lower payment may be appealing, but often loan providers will use lower payments to get you to take
            the loan out, but in the long run you end up paying more in interest.
        </p>

        <h3> Typical Loan Terms </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Student Loans: 10 years</li>
            <li>Auto Loans: 2 - 7 years</li>
            <li>Personal Loans: 1 - 7 years</li>
            <li>House Loans: 15 - 30 years</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Loans don't necessary have to be within these terms, but these are the typical amounts of time that these loans are provided. Loan providers
            especially whenever discussing auto loans will take advantage of a consumers lack of financial knowledge to entertain the lower monthly payment
            over a longer term in order to sell a car and get them to agree to loan terms.
        </p>
        <h3> Consequences of not paying loans </h3>

        <p>Unfortunately complete non-payment of loans isn't really an option because it will come with a number of consequences</p>

            <h3>Auto Loans</h3>
            <p>Non-payment of auto loans typically leads to repossession of the car you are making payments on.</p>
            <h3>Personal Loans</h3>
            <p>Non-payment of a personal loan will hurt your creditscore more severly than non-payment of other forms of credit
                and some personal loans require collateral which can be taken by a lender in cases of non-payment.
            </p>
            <h3>Home Loans</h3>
            <p>Non-payment of home loans can lead to the property being foreclosed on which is simply whenever the bank repossesses
                land due to non-payment of a mortgage
            </p>
            <h3>Student Loans</h3>
            <p>Student Loans are the most interesting of the bunch. There is essentially no way for you to get rid of student loans without
                you paying on them as legally there is no way to get rid of student loan debt through bankruptcy. Lack of payment on student loans
                can eventually lead to tax returns being seized, paychecks being garnished directly from your paychecks and sent to the government. If
                you are in a situation where making payments is rough there are federal programs that can lower your payment or defer it for a later date
                without any later legal or severe financial consequences like wage garnishment.

        <h1> Calculating investment </h1>

        <p>Investment financially is a similar concept to loans only the rate of return is an typically an
            estimated average unless its interest yielded from something like a savings account which typically is guarunteed return, but if you
            are basing it off the market it will be based on the estimated or average return rate historically.
